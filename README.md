# Neural Networks for Short-Selling Analysis in Financial Markets

## Abstract
Embark on an in-depth journey through our cutting-edge exploration of neural networks applied to unravel the intricate tapestry of short-selling dynamics in financial markets. This project strategically leverages the sophisticated capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models, intricately entwined with key financial indicators such as MACD and RSI. Our overarching objective is to not only predict stock market trends but also discern optimal timeframes for executing strategic short-selling maneuvers. Through an exhaustive series of experiments, our findings not only underscore the seamless integration of deep learning techniques with traditional financial indicators but also shed light on their collaborative efficacy in elevating risk assessment and refining decision-making in the dynamic landscape of trading, with a specialized focus on the nuanced art of short selling.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
At the crux of our investigation lies a meticulous data collection process. Employing Python's yfinance library, we meticulously amassed stock market data for the top 20 companies within the S&P500 index. The dataset, spanning the temporal canvas from 2020 to 2022, lays a robust foundation for an immersive exploration of market dynamics.

### Market Indicator Calculations
A profound understanding of market dynamics necessitates the computation of a comprehensive suite of 25 market indicators. Each indicator is a meticulously crafted tool, strategically designed to tackle multifaceted tasks such as identifying recent trends, quantifying stock strength, gauging volatility, and precisely calculating trading volume.

### Data Preprocessing
Ensuring the pristine quality of our models' input data is paramount. The preprocessing journey unfolds as a symphony of data cleaning, normalization, integration, transformation into time-series data, rigorous validation, and meticulous feature selection. Each step is a crucial chord in orchestrating the symphony of accurate predictions.

### Model Design
The heart of our predictive prowess lies in the intricately designed model architecture. A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) stand as sentinels, poised to predict future stock values based on the historical tapestry of indicators. This strategic design is tailored to encapsulate the nuanced subtleties of ever-evolving market dynamics.

### Performance Evaluation
The litmus test for our models unfolds in a rigorous performance evaluation. Comparative analysis of GRU and LSTM predictions against actual stock prices serves as a beacon, illuminating the promising accuracy and validation of our chosen models.

### Future Stock Data Prediction
Armed with the wisdom of the past, we project our gaze into the future. The trained LSTM and GRU models unfold their predictive wings to foresee future stock data for the upcoming 7 business days. This forward-looking approach seamlessly weaves together past insights and corresponding indicator values for a holistic prediction.

### Interactive Trading Guide
Our commitment to practical utility materializes in the form of a basic-level interactive system crafted with Python. This intuitive guide steers users toward optimal shorting periods and times, accompanied by a granular quantitative analysis of profit margins, courtesy of the GRU and LSTM models.

## Results and Conclusion
The crescendo of our analysis resonates in the revelation of the remarkable accuracy of the GRU model, boasting a minimal Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.00081. The LSTM model, while carrying a slightly higher MSE of 0.00657, stands as a stalwart in identifying nuanced market trends. However, both models exhibit inherent limitations in promptly detecting abrupt and unusual changes in stock prices, adding a note of realism to their predictive prowess.
